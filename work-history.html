            <p>In 2004 at the age of 15 I was employed by Bob See as a Glassy at the Grand Hotel in Gladstone. After a school enrolled work-experience program, I was honoured to be offered to stay on as a staff-member. I worked for Bob for roughly two years and gained a knowledge of hospitality and customer service.</p>
            <p>I also worked for Players nightclub (now defunct) in Gladstone, overlapping my time at the Grand Hotel and finishing up just after I graduated highschool in 2006.</p>
            <p>After highschool, I joined the NAVY as an Marine Technician. I served for six years. During this time I was deployed to Melbourne and Sydney. I served on ships HMAS Manoora, Kanimbla and Tobruk. While in the navy I attained a cert 4 in Marine Tech. Some Of my many qualifications from this time include, welding/brazing/soldering, electrical, woodwork, machining and lathing, heavy diesel and plant mechanical and many more. I completed further study in the area of gauge and instrument calibration. I left the NAVY with an honourable discharge in late 2012. My time in the military instilled discipline in me, and pride in my work.</p>
            <p>In 2013 after I left the military I briefly worked at the Gladstone Airport as a baggage handler for Virgin Airlines. This job was one of the most enjoyable I've ever had. The workplace had a high sense of comradery. This job helped to reinforce ethical values in me, being trusted handling customers' belongings safely while still hittings all timeframes.</p>
            <p>Late in 2013, I was offered a job by Bechtel to work on the construction G.L.N.G natural gas terminal as a Trade's assistant. Again, I was blessed to have a high sense of comradery in this job and learnt many things in the area of electrical and safety. I was made redundant as the construction was coming to a close in late 2015</p>
            <p>After G.L.N.G, also in late 2015, I received an offer to work in my father's business in Bundaberg. He the owns ENZED hydraulics Bundaberg branch. I worked this job as an hydraulic fitter and eventually manager, only leaving to start my full-stack web dev course in Feb 2022. My time at ENZED helped me to learn about managing staff and balancing work/customer relationships. It was always a balancing act to keep my employers, my team and my customers happy all at once! But it was a challenge that I rose to.</p>
