            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about">Hi, I'm Sonny! I live in Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia and am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I live with my partner Erin, my four-month old baby Theo, and our kelpie-cross, Ren. I am something of a hobby-hopper, with interests in hiking and kayaking, yoga, cars, and even a brief Powerboat Racing career. But my longest serving passions are martial arts and motorcylces.</p> 
            <p class="about">I am a purple belt in Briazilian Jiu Jitsu and train 4-6 times per week, for roughly the past 7 years (not counting breaks due to work scheduling). I also teach an MMA class for aspiring fighters. This has led to one of my other hobbies, which is learning Portuguese. I started learning a couple of years ago, with the intention of travelling to Brazil to train and compete in BJJ and Vale Tudo (pre-Covid.) Although I don't know when I might make it to Brazil, I continue my studies in Portuguese as I enjoy learning this language.</p>
            <p class="about">I have several (too many), motorcylces. These include a '96 Harley Davidson fxwd Dyna Wide Glide, a 1980 Kawasaki Z650 cafe racer, and my '08 Honda CRF 450X, which I bought new as a struggling youth in the military. I have been riding motorcycles since I was about 4 years old, although I never seem to get any better at it, and have many battle-scars to prove it.</p>
            <p class="about">More recently and due to injury from MMA, I picked up a guitar, which is something I had always wanted to do. It happened as I really could not even move from my bed for about six weeks, and didn't want to just waste my time watching Netflix. I'm so glad I did (Erin, not so much), as it has opened my eyes to a whole new world. In the future I am hoping to stoke the fires of this new passion along with another new passion for coding and tech!</p>
